Add an appropriate config file to your uWSGI [`Emperor`](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Emperor.html) config directory. A skeleton config would be (in the INI syntax):\r\n\r\n        [uwsgi]\r\n        chdir = /path/to/on-verra\r\n        home = /path/to/on-verra-virtualenv-if-applicable\r\n        module = q:app\r\n        \r\n        socket = :8002\r\n\r\n    Your `socket` may be different depending on how you expose uWSGI to the world. I mostly just pulled this from my config.\r\n\r\n2. Connect to nginx or whatever else you're running in front of uWSGI. An example nginx config block would be:\r\n\r\n        location /on-verra/ {\r\n            include uwsgi_params;\r\n            uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:8002;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\n*The Fair License:*\r\n\r\nCopyright 2015 Ben Cook.\r\n\r\nUsage of the works is permitted provided that this instrument is retained with the works, so that any entity that uses the works is notified of this instrument.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: THE WORKS ARE WITHOUT WARRANTY.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
